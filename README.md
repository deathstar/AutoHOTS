# AutoHOTS 2.0

AutoHOTS is designed to make your Heroes of the Storm experience more enjoyable. 
Using it is completely within the terms of service and cannot be considered cheating. This program is simply
designed to improve your experience by automating mundane repetative tasks. A simple example of 
the use of the script would be the Lili Autohealer script. It can automatically press Q whenever 
it is off cooldown so the person playing Lili doesn't have to hold down Q. Another example would be using the 
auto loot box opening feature which will automatically open loot boxes for you so you don't have to.
