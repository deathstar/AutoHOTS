AutoHots V2.0 

These AutoHotKey scripts are designed to make your Heroes of the Storm experience more enjoyable. 
They are completely within the terms of service and cannot be considered a cheat. They are simply
designed to improve your experience by automating mundane repetative tasks. A simple example of 
the use of the script would be the Lili Autohealer script. It can automatically press Q whenever 
it is off cooldown so the person playing Lili doesn't have to hold down Q.
